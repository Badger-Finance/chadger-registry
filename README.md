# Chadger Registry

##Â Credits

Adapted by the work by JTP and OxDhan

## Simple predictable multi-chain deployment
Instead of using a factory or shenanigans, just:
- Write the contract
- Flatten it
- Deploy it via a fresh account on each new chain

The address is a product of Bytecode + nonce, hence a fresh account makes all future deployments consistent

## Current Deployments:
Chadger Deployer: 0xc4ad32Cadd69F27DEF845db2fFDb720fD58FaB02
